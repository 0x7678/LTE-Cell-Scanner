LTE Cell Scanner / Tracker

This is a collection of tools to locate and track LTE basestation cells using
very low performance RF front ends. For example, these tools work with RTL2832
based dongles (E4000, R820T, etc.) which have a noise figure of 20dB, only 8
bits in the A/D, and a crystal with a frequency error of about 100 ppm.

The main documentation in html format can be found on the web at:

And in the doc/index.html subdirectory of this distribution.

Quick build instructions:
