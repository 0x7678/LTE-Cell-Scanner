TDD, external-LNB, and fater pre-searcher are added now! In the future this will be merged back to https://github.com/Evrytania/LTE-Cell-Scanner

ATTENTION!!! I find that LTE-Cell-Scanner only works with v0.5.2 librtlsdr (https://github.com/steve-m/librtlsdr). Not v0.5.3! (at least in my computer)

I study and do experiments using MATLAB in this repo: https://github.com/JiaoXianjun/rtl-sdr-LTE

Some usages of new features
-----------------------------------------------------------------

"CellSearch --help" to see all options.

"CellSearch --freq-start 1860e6 --recbin a.bin" to save signal in file a.bin while doing cell search at frequency 1.86GHz

"CellSearch --loadbin test/f1890_s1.92_g0_0.16s.bin" to search LTE cell in captured bin file test/f1890_s1.92_g0_0.16s.bin

"CellSearch --freq-start 1860e6 --num-try 10" to try to perform 10 tries of searching at frequency 1.86GHz (When signal is weak, only one try may not have you good luck)

"CellSearch --freq-start 1860e6 -t" to use original carrier-sampling twisted mode. (My new developed mode is non-twisted mode (default mode), which supports external LNB and fast pre-search. See detailed explanation in https://github.com/JiaoXianjun/rtl-sdr-LTE)

If you find different search results between two modes (twisted and non-twisted), please capture the signal into bin file and tell me.
Thanks!

LTE Cell Scanner / Tracker
--------------------------

This is a collection of tools to locate and track LTE basestation cells using
very low performance RF front ends. For example, these tools work with RTL2832
based dongles (E4000, R820T, etc.) which have a noise figure of 20dB, only 8
bits in the A/D, and a crystal with a frequency error of about 100 ppm.

The 'CellSearch' program can be used to search for LTE carriers within a range
of frequencies.  Once an LTE frequency has been located, 'LTE-Tracker' can be
used to monitor and track, in realtime, any LTE cells on that frequency.

The main documentation in html format can be found on the web at:
  http://www.evrytania.com/lte-tools
And in the doc/index.html subdirectory of this distribution.
